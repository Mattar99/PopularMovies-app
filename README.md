## How to Work with the Source
The app fetches movie information using [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API.
You have to enter your own API key into `gradle.properties` file.

```gradle.properties
MOVIE_DB_API_KEY="Your Api Key"
```

If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an [API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) .
